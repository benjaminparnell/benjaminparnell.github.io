title: Getting started with Vim
---

[Vim](http://www.vim.org/) is my full time text editor. But this post isn't
going to be about how you should also use it as your full time text editor - I
don't think that makes sense for most normal people.

If you are a developer, you are probably going to come into contact with Vim at
some stage. Whether its to edit your commit messages if you use the Git CLI or
you need to make some edits to a file while in an ssh session, Vim is probably
what you will use.

This post is more like a list of resources that helped me get started with Vim,
in the hope that it might help someone else begin there path to enlightenment in
the future.

### Learning the key binds

My favorite things about Vim are that its **highly configurable** and has
shortcuts in abundance. Lots of its built in features and keyboard based
navigation make simple file editing a breeze.

Here are some great resources for getting started with Vim **without configuring
it at all**.

* [http://vim-adventures.com/](http://vim-adventures.com/) is a browser based
    adventure game that's aim is to teach you many of Vim's core features.
* [http://www.openvim.com/](http://www.openvim.com/) is a browser console based
    tutorial.
* [vimtutor](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/vimtutor1.html) - if you have Vim
    installed, your probably have this command too. It starts up the Vim tutor
    program, which is a text file of instructions and execises you can follow.
<br><br>

All that can seem a bit tedious at first - but that's because its something that
we don't have to deal with due to modern text editors existing. The mouse can
perform most of these functions for us in Sublime Text etc. But once you master
Vim's key binds and shortcuts, I can guarantee you will be editing text much
faster than before.

### Configuring Vim

Vim can be molded to be nearly anything. The default configuration is just a
start - you can add key maps, functions that execute when you are in different
modes, and plugins that add heaps of functionality to the editor.

You can configure Vim via the ~/.vimrc file. Rather than go in depth about what
you can put in there, I would suggest reading some examples.

* [Amir Salihefendic's "Ultimate Vim
    Configuration"](https://amix.dk/vim/vimrc.html)
* [Tim Pope's
    "sensible.vim"](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible/blob/master/plugin/sensible.vim)
* Or you can check out [my
    vimrc](https://github.com/benjaminparnell/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc)
<br><br>
As you can gather from those, there isn't really a limit to what you can do
with Vim configuration. Most of the cool stuff you can add to Vim can be
achieved with plugins.

### Plugins

If you are going to install plugins for Vim, you probably care about using it
beyond more than simple file edits. So you are probably going to want a way to
manage your plugins.

There are a lot of solutions for plugin management out there. Tim Pope's
[pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) is a very popular one, but
that doesn't provide an easy way to actually document which plugins you are using. I
personally use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) which does offer
a way to document which plugins you have installed, and gives you some nice
configuration options for when plugins load, including what file types to load
them for, so if you have a lot of plugins you won't have a long start up time
when you launch the editor. Check out the [vim-plug
readme](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for more information.

But the above doesn't matter that much. Choose a plugin manager that you can get
on with.

#### Recommended Plugins

I have 62 Vim plugins installed at the time of writing. That is quite a few, and
I am not going to bore you with all of them. But here are the ones I find most
useful.

* [vim-sensible](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible).
    I don't actually use this myself, but it provides a lot of good defaults
    that I have ended up with anyway.
* [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) is the best Git wrapper
    for Vim. It offers handy shortcuts for doing almost all Git actions, and
    provides :Gbrowse for linking to the file you have open in Vim on GitHub.
* [nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) is a file browser for Vim,
    similar to the tree view from Sublime Text/Atom, and makes it easy to
    create, move and delete files.
* [fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) provides fuzzy file/buffer
    finding in Vim that is super fast. Requires you to have
    [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) installed too.

Most of the rest of my plugins are installed through personal preference or
because of my use of the language that the plugin caters for in some way. If you
